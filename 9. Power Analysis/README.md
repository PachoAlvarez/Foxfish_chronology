#### Power Analysis

For background on power analyses, please visit my [wiki](https://github.com/emboylen/EBHonoursThesis/wiki/9.-Power-Analysis "EBHonoursThesis wiki").
######Caution!
Running these simulations can take a very long time, depending on your machine.
My analyses took up to 6 hours per simulation (total = 24+ hours). 

Please consider running a seperate machine or plan ahead.

* **Run_Power_Analysis.R**: an R script which runs the complete power analysis simulation for each species (Fox = Foxfish), each region (West, South) at 0.01 and 0.05 significance level ("..._1Sig.R" = 0.01).
*  **Power_Analysis_SouthFox_1Sig.R**: simulation for South Coast foxfish, sig = 0.01
*  **Power_Analysis_SouthFox_5Sig.R**: simulation for South Coast foxfish, sig = 0.05
