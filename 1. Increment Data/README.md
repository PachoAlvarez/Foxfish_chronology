# Increment Data

The fish otoliths have been sectioned, set in resin, and photographed with a microscope. These increments are then measured on a program using [Image J](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) with the plug-in IncMeas (Rountrey 2009).  

These measurements have then been exported as .csv files. Two researchers (EB and PC) determined the measurements, so the mean of the two will have to be calculated.
