## Environmental Varibales
To see which environmental variables drive the growth of fox fish _Bodianus frenchii_, I will be testing for correlations in time series between the increment chronologies and the environmental variables. The variables I will be using are:
* **SST**: Sea Surface Temperature
* **FSL**: Fremantle Sea Level - a proxy for Leeuwin Current

I have downloaded multiple .txt.gz files for [Hadley Sea Surface Temperature](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/data/download.html) observations. The data have been unzipped, resulting in mutiple .txt files in [ASCII format.](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/data/Read_instructions_sst.txt).
