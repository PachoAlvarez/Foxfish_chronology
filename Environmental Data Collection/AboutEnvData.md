# Environmental Varibales
To see which environmental variables drive the growth of fox fish _Bodianus frenchii_, I will be testing for correlations between  the increment chronologies and the environmental variable chronologies. The variables I will be using are:
* **SST**: Sea Surface Temperature
* **FSL**: Fremantle Sea Level - a proxy for Leeuwin Current

## Sea Surface Temperature
I have downloaded multiple .txt.gz files for [Hadley Sea Surface Temperature](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/data/download.html) observations. The data have been unzipped (UnZip_Data.R), resulting in mutiple .txt files in [ASCII format.](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/data/Read_instructions_sst.txt).

## Fremantle Sea Level
Australian Sea Level Data can be saved from the [Bureau of Meteorology website](http://www.bom.gov.au/oceanography/tides/monthly/)(the FSL data I used can be found [here](http://www.bom.gov.au/ntc/IDO70000/IDO70000_62230_SLD.txt).
