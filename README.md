Honours Thesis - Ellen Boylen, Murdoch University
===============

This repositry contains the data and R scripts for my Honours Thesis, which looks at the affect of environmental drivers on the growth of Foxfish (Bodianus frenchii) on the west and south coast of Australia. To evaluate the environmental effects, otolith chronologies are constructed, using dendrochronology techniques.
