Honours Thesis - Ellen Boylen, Murdoch University
===============

This repositry contains the data and R scripts for my Honours Thesis, which looks at the affect of environmental drivers on the growth of Foxfish (Bodianus frenchii) on the west and south coast of Australia. To evaluate the environmental effects, otolith chronologies are constructed, using dendrochronology techniques.

Otoliths are fish earbones, and are similar to tree rings - they both have growth rings which form annually and are used for ageing. The spaceing between the growth rings is what is used in the chronology. The chronology consists of the increment widths, for the whole sample of fish, for the assigned year. The years are assigned to the increments by knowing the year of death, and counting backwards towards the centre of the otolith.
