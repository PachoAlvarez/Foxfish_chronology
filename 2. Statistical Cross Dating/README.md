# Statistical Cross Dating 
#### Using a dendrochronology program in R (dplR)

For a description of what crossdating, and in particular, statistical cross-dating is - see my [wiki page](https://github.com/emboylen/EBHonoursThesis/wiki/2.-Statistical-Cross-Dating).

In this section - I will be not only cross-dating the combined data, but also comparing PC's and EB's measurements, to see if:
* Combining the data was useful, or
* If either researcher's measurements were better (indicated by the higher inter-series correlation, lower standard deviations, etc.)

Data for these srcipts is the data generated in [part 1, Increment Data](https://github.com/emboylen/EBHonoursThesis/tree/master/1.%20Increment%20Data) - particularly the combined data, as well as some raw data.
